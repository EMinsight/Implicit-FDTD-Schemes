# ADI-FDTD FDTD code for general dispersive media
The folder "3D_cavity" contain the MATLAB code which implements the ADI-FDTD method for general dispersive media (modified Lorentz dispersion model) proposed in the paper: 

**K. P. Prokopidis and D. C. Zografopoulos** ''Generalised 3-D ADI-FDTD algorithm for wave propagation in dispersive media,'' *Electronics Letters*, vol. 53, no. 18, pp. 1242-1244, 31st Aug. 2017 [DOI: 10.1049/el.2017.2336](http://dx.doi.org/10.1049/el.2017.2336)

The dispersive medium is assumed "modified" Lorentz - a general form which incorporates all the traditional dispersion models, i.e. static conductivity, Drude, Debye, Lorentz, Drude-critical points, partial functions and complex-conjugate pair residues.
